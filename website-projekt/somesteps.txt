To add functionality to the dashboard where users can create and edit blog posts, and others can rate those posts later on the "my-blog" page, you'll need to implement several features:

Database Structure: Set up a database with tables to store user information, blog posts, and ratings.
Dashboard UI: Create a user-friendly interface on the dashboard page where users can create new blog posts and edit their existing posts.
Backend Functionality: Implement backend functionality to handle blog post creation, editing, and updating in the database.
Display Posts on "my-blog" Page: Retrieve and display blog posts from the database on the "my-blog" page, allowing users to view and rate them.
Rating System: Implement a rating system that allows users to rate blog posts, and store these ratings in the database.
Let's break down each step in more detail:

1. Database Structure:

Create tables for users, blog posts, and ratings.
Users table should store user information like username, password, etc.
Blog posts table should store post content, author information, and timestamps.
Ratings table should store user ratings for each blog post.
2. Dashboard UI:

Design a dashboard interface where users can create new blog posts and edit existing ones.
Include input fields for post title, content, and any other relevant information.
Provide options for saving drafts, publishing posts, and editing existing posts.
3. Backend Functionality:

Create PHP scripts to handle form submissions from the dashboard.
Implement functions to insert new blog posts into the database and update existing ones.
Add authentication checks to ensure that only logged-in users can access the dashboard and modify their own posts.
4. Display Posts on "my-blog" Page:

Retrieve blog posts from the database and display them on the "my-blog" page.
Include author information, post content, and any other relevant details.
Implement pagination or infinite scrolling if there are a large number of posts.
5. Rating System:

Create functionality to allow users to rate blog posts.
Add UI elements for users to submit ratings, such as star ratings or thumbs up/down buttons.
Store user ratings in the ratings table in the database and update the average rating for each post.
Once you have implemented these features, users will be able to create and edit blog posts from the dashboard, and other users can view and rate these posts on the "my-blog" page.
